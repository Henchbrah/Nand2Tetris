This repository contains ins code for the second of five software development projects presented in The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, a Virtual Machine translator for the Hack platform. This is the first step toward building a compiler for a typical object-based high-lebel programming language. The VM is stack-based and will serve as the backend of our compiler.
