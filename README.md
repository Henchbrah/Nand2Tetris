The brief description of these projects follows. However, for full specifications of Hack hardware/software please see www.nand2tetris.org



Starting with the construction of elementary logic gates, we go bottom-up to combinational and sequential chips (chapters 2–3), through the design of a typical computer architecture (chapters 4–5) and a typical software hierarchy (chapters 6–8), all the way to implementing a compiler (chapters 10–11) for a modern object-based language (chapter 9), ending with the design and implementation of a simple operating system (chapter 12).
